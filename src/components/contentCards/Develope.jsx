                    SB Admin 2 makes extensive use of Bootstrap 4 utility classes in order to reduce
                    CSS bloat and poor page performance. Custom CSS classes are used to create
                    custom components and custom utility classes.
                </p>
                <p className='mb-0'>
                    Before working with this theme, you should become familiar with the
                    Bootstrap framework, especially the utility classes.
